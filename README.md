# Pse-lang
Learning programming language with beginner-friendly features.

# Objective
To provide an interactive, small yet feature-sufficient language alongside a lightweight environment to be used with the purpose of learning the basics of programming.

# Samples
Check out the test/ directory for a list of example programs.

# How to use
Write your main, transpile ES6 to ES5, and make it runnable in the browser with browserify or something similar.
I have provided in the example/ directory an example, final app. Just open pse.html in the browser.

# TODO
* Generate equivallent .cpp code.
* Provide tips and suggestions for improving the code (the pse code).
